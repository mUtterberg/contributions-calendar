# contributions-calendar
Working on parsing my activity with GitHub's api and [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/StatsCommitActivity.html).

.py files only available locally during development, due to my use of a personal access token.
Progress files, however, are in [a public repo](https://github.com/mUtterberg/contributions-calendar).

Alex Chan was able to [replicate GitHub's contributions calendar](https://github.com/alexwlchan/contributions-graph).
